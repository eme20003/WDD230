        <p>Our first recommendation is to visit our clean, safe, and most of all cool beaches! Enjoy the Atlantic ocean at its max or just visit 
            some of our iconic lighthouses that brought ships into safe harbor! One of our most favorite activites is dune jumping! Take you choice
            of a vessle and slide (or jump) off our sand dunes to give you a fun and full day.  Just don't forget your sunscreen!

        </div>

        <p>Finished with your trip to the beach, and need a place to go?  Take a look at our small towns! Some of these towns are as old as the colonial
            days itself! There are plenty of small shops, restraunts, and hotels to allow you to take a nice streach without feeling cramped up within a big 
            city.  Our townsfolk are just as friendly as the town itself! Feel free to take a look around and even meet some new faces.
