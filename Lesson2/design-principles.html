        <div class='Hicks-Law'>
            <h1>Hicks Law:</h1>
            <h2><strong>Company:<strong> Obsidan</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://obsidian.md/">https://obsidian.md</a></h2>
            <img src="\images\HicksLaw_WDD230.png" alt="Hicks Law demonstration">
            <p>Hicks law states that the more simple the design is, the more likely the user is to stay
                and to more easily make decisions without being frustrated or unhappy with their experience.
                In Obsidians website, the first thing that you are able to find is a small description which is not 
                too long, and a button to immediately download their software.  This displays hicks law as there is 
                a ver simple decision to make, to download the application or not! And nothing more, this is easy for the 
                user to decide, or if they wish to look more into Obsidian, they are able to do so by just scrolling and 
                learning more, with again just the decision to download the application or not.  This is why I have chosen
                this website as my example for hicks law.

        <div class ='RuleOfThirds'>
            <h1>Rule Of Thrids:</h1>
            <h2><strong>Company:</strong> Porche</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.porsche.com/middle-east/">https://www.porsche.com/middle-east<a></h2>
            <img src="\images\RuleOfThirds_WDD230.png" alt="Rule of Thrids demonstration">
            <p>The rule of thrids states that you can draw 2 lines horizontally and vertically evenly through an image 
                to display 9 squares, and much of the 'weight' of the image is within the first third of the image.  I chose
                Porche's website as my rule of thrids as many of their images displayed has their product (cars) many of their 
                images are weighted on the left side of their images with their car, and not as much weight on the right hand side.
                This is why Porche's websites display rule of thrids well.
            </p>

        <div class="Proximity">
            <h1>Proximity:</h1>
            <h2><strong>Compnay:</strong> Amazon</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">https://www.amazon.com</a></h2>
            <img src="\images\Proximity_WDD230.png" alt="Proximity demonstration">
            <p>For proximity, I have chosen Amazons website.  Proximity describes the closeness of objects from one to another, 
                in Amazons websites all their products that they offer, are all in very close proximity to eachother, with nearly no whitespace
                at all.  This provides the user with the idea that they sell much more than just one or more items, and helps the user
                understand that Amazon sells much more than what appears.  This is why Amazon displays 'proximity' perfectly.
